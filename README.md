- Started by designing each page of our app on Figma
- Opened the terminal and run the command `npm create vite@latest`, typed `Reddy_43_Client` as the Project name, selected `React` as a framework, and selected `JavaScript` as a variant
- Created folders called `pages` and `components` inside the `src` folder and inside those folders created folders for each page and component.
- Inside each of these folders we created an index.jsx file
- For styling we created css files and for testing created test files inside each folder
- We did overall styling inside App.css file
